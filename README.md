What does the Mobbr plugin do?
------------------------------

The Mobbr plugin inserts the Mobbr metadata in the HTML of the Q2A pages and optionally shows the Mobbr buttons. This makes question/answer threads payable, or donatable. The amount is divided among all participants in the thread and all participants in the community in such a way that everybody who added value, shares in the revenues.
If no answer is selected yet for the thread, the button is in 'pledge' mode ( button is green ), basically enabling crowdfunding of the thread. After an answer is selected or funds a divided among the participants and the button is switched to normal pay mode ( button is blue ).  

The button automatically chooses a different payment key depending on the page on which it is used. To pay all community members ( a share of the ad revenues for instance ), use the button on the front-page or members list page. To pay for the answers on the question, use the button on the thread pages.
